# Backend Documentation for Frontend Features

This document outlines the features currently implemented in the frontend that do not have corresponding dedicated API endpoints. This guide is intended to help backend developers understand the data requirements and frontend implementation details.
(I know I can describe API endpoint in the Next itself but I did not plan to make an web app)
## 1. User Profile Page

### Description

The user profile page displays a user's profile information and a list of their posts.

### Frontend Implementation

- **Route:** `/profile/[username]`
- **Client Component:** `src/app/(main)/profile/[username]/ProfileClient.tsx`
- **Data Fetching:** The component fetches the entire feed using `getFeed()` from `src/lib/api.ts` and then filters the posts by the `username` from the URL.

### Backend Requirements

- A dedicated API endpoint to fetch a user's profile information by their username.
- A dedicated API endpoint to fetch all posts by a specific user.

## 2. Single Post Page

### Description

The single post page displays a specific post and its comments.

### Frontend Implementation

- **Route:** `/post/[id]`
- **Client Component:** `src/app/(main)/post/[id]/PostClient.tsx`
- **Data Fetching:** The component fetches the post data using `getPostById(id)` from `src/lib/api.ts`, where `id` is from the URL.

### Backend Requirements

- The current `getPostById(id)` function is sufficient, but it's important to ensure it returns the full post object with comments.

## 3. Feed Page

### Description

The feed page displays a list of all posts from all users.

### Frontend Implementation

- **Route:** `/feed`
- **Component:** `src/app/(main)/feed/page.tsx`
- **Data Fetching:** The component fetches all posts using `getFeed()` from `src/lib/api.ts`.

### Backend Requirements

- The current `getFeed()` function is sufficient. No new endpoint is immediately required for this feature, but pagination should be considered for the future.

## 4. User and Post Types

For reference, here are the TypeScript types used for `User` and `Post` objects on the frontend. The backend should aim to provide data that conforms to these structures.

- **Types file:** `src/types/index.ts`
